# Mina Implementation

Hello all, 

This project is generally the zkApps that I am building.
These zkApps are tested locally and are working fine. 

Anyone can use them.
Just git clone the repositories. 
The project is created using npm so you can install dependencies.

To run the project you need to run this command in root directory.

```
npm run build && node build/src/main.js
```
